The files in this directory implement the PHG-to-p4est wrapper, which allows
a same PHG program to work with both conforming adaptive tetrahedral meshes
and non-conforming adaptive hexahedral meshes.

For examples on using this wrapper, go to the directory ../examples and try:
	make clean
	make USER_CFLAGS=-DPHG_TO_P4EST ipdg		# 1st example
	make USER_CFLAGS=-DPHG_TO_P4EST interface	# 2nd example

Note:
 1. The wrapper is enabled by defining the macro "PHG_TO_P4EST".
    The macro PHG_TO_P4EST is used in user programs to determine whether
    tetrahedral meshes or hexahedral meshes are being used.

 2. Programs which intend to use this wrapper can only call a subset of the
    PHG functions for managing GRIDs and DOFs. If an unsupported function is
    called, compiler errors or runtime errors would occur.

 3. Only DG type finite elements and cuboid elements are currently supported.
